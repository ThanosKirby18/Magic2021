Advance Java Topics

August 17, 2022

Project Description: The goal of this assignment was to put into practice everything we learned in the pervious years. We had to create several enemy and Allied classes
based of of fiction creatures. We had to use a variety of Constructors, Getters, Setters, Brain Methods, toStrings. 

More Info: This project was a school assignment for Advanced Java Topics. This project served me very well as a way to revisit concepts that were forgotten due to lack of 
practice during the summer.
